# Camera One
Camera One is an experiment that can bring together the open-source hardware and software communities, machining experts, tinkerers, professional photographers and digital Debbie's alike to build a world class scalable product. This camera is designed to fit firmly in the Medium Format class of cameras but not be afraid to venture into the Large or Small format ecosystems by creating ample room for 4x5 film and 35mm mechanisms alike.  The Initial release has been slated to be released as a 35mm film camera but in the future, digital backs are coming! 

# Goals
## The Initial Design  
The initial v1.0 release milestone will mark the completion of several key conditions. Camera One v1.0 will be a functional 35mm film camera with M42 lens mounting system and pneumatically driven bulb and/or time shutter based on the Packard design.

# How The Project Works
Currently this project is being developed in Solidworks using STereoLithography files for GitHub support and feature tracking, as well as 3D Manufacturing Format to allow for easy prototyping.

To contribute to this project just edit the Solidworks part files (.SLDPRT) save that file to .SLDPRT, .STL and .3MF and submit. As always thank you for contributing!
