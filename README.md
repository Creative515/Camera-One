# Camera-One
Camera One is an Open Source modular camera system designed for still photography. The idea behind this camera is to make a truly customizable experience, one where you can build the camera for the photograph, not the other way around.

Currently this project is being developed in Solidworks Though first order of business is to get the .STL files uploaded for online viewing, tracking, and printing if necessary.
