<p>Camera One is an Open Source Modular Camera System designed for still photography. The idea behind this camera is to make a truly customizable experience, one where you can build the camera for the photograph, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Currently this project is being developed in Solidworks using STereoLithography files for Github support and feature tracking, as well as 3D Manufacturing Format to allow support for easy manufacturing. </p>
